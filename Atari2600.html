            This is a WIP cycle-accurate Atari2600 emulator. I saw Sethbling's
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq7T5_xH24M"
                >Atari Emulator in Minecraft</a
            >
            and was inspired to write my own emulator (but in Java, not
            Minecraft). I started this project in Sept 2020, but I put it on
            hold when school started. I plan on finalizing it during winter
            break.<br /><br />

            So far, the CPU has been completely written, although it's far from
            bug-free. The TIA has the background, playfield, and player
            registers implemented, but there are still some option registers
            that need to be added. There is no user input or sound.<br /><br />

            Here is the background and playfield working:<br />

            Here are the 2 players rendered with the registers being incremented
            every scanline, as well as playfield mirroring:<br />

        <p>
            If I try to run the emulator with a Donkey Kong rom, the first few
            lines get rendered but the rest of the screen is blank for some
            reason. The fact that there is anything rendering at all means that
            it is more likely because the TIA is incomplete than because of a
            CPU bug.<br />
